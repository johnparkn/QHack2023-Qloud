# Project decription
For cloud service with the multi-server, it is important to make operation costs down and use energy efficiently. By solving the bin packing problem, jobs can be efficiently allocated to machines for cloud service. However, the bin packing problem is an Np-hard problem so itâ€™s difficult to solve classically. In this project, we will try several quantum optimization algorithms to solve bin packing problems for cloud computing services.

Detail problem, method, simulation, result, disccusion and references are included in Qloud.pdf.
